# Explanation how we can optimize the function further 

## Problem explanation
    - The standanrd Levenstein algorithm uses the DP table of size "n x m" where:
        n = length of string s1
        m = length of string s2
    - This results in :
        Time Complexity: O(n x m)
        Space Complexity: O(n x m)
    This is efficient for the small inputs but if we have very large string then this approach can become impractical due to the memory and time constraints.


## So to optimize the above problem we can use the following techniques:

    1. Space optimisation by using only two rows of the array:-
        - So in this technique we don't need to store the entire DP matrix rather we will use only two rows i.e previous row and currect row at any time.

        Above is the provide snapshot of the optimized code.
        - This will reduce the space complexity and final space complexity will be :- 
            - Space Complexity :- O(min(n,m));

    2. Optimising the time by using early termination:-
        - As we can see that in the standard levenstein algorithm we use to compute the entire DP table even if we have to only care about whether distance <= k.
        - For example like if we see in real world scenario like in spell checker if a maximum acceptable distance k is known we can abort the calculation early when it exceeds this threshold.
        - This will avoid the uncessary computations and this will might optimize the time a bit.
