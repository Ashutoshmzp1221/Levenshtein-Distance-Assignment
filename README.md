# Levenshtein Distance Assignment â€“ OneBanc

## Content

### Task 1: Basic Edit Distance funtion
- File: `task1.cpp`
- Uses the standard dynamic programming method to compute Levenshtein Distance with equal costs(like for each operation either it is insertion, deletion or substitution the cost is 1)

### Task 2: Weighted Edit Distance funtion
- File: `task2.cpp`
- It also uses the standard dynamic programming methode to compute Levenshtein Distance with custom insertion, deletion and subtitution cost.

### Task 2: Spell Checker funtion
- File: `task3.cpp`
- It is used to suggest the closest word from a dictionary using the weighted edit distance methode.

### Task 4: Optimised version of basic edit distance function
- File: `task4.cpp` and `task4_Explanation.md`
- task4.cpp contains the space optimised code for the standard levenshtein algorithm.
- task4_Explanation.md it contains the explanation. Discussion of the time and space optimisation.
